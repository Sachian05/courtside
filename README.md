#= SPEC-001: Courtside - Local Basketball Game Tracker
:sectnums:
:toc:

== Background

The game of basketball is played in thousands of local settings—parks, recreational centers, and private leagues—where personal statistics and game data are rarely tracked. Unlike professional or semi-professional leagues, individuals and teams in these local games lack access to analytics tools that could improve their skills or showcase performance trends.

The Courtside app seeks to fill this gap by providing a platform for tracking personal data (e.g., points, rebounds, assists) and private game statistics, catering to local basketball games. The platform will have two interfaces:  
- **iOS Mobile App**: For live scorekeeping and game tracking during games.  
- **Web App**: For detailed post-game analytics, historical data, and game-sharing capabilities.  

The app will prioritize privacy and accessibility while offering robust features for recreational players and leagues.

== Requirements

Courtside will address the following product and technical requirements. These are categorized using the MoSCoW prioritization framework:  

=== Must-Have  
- **User Authentication**: Secure sign-up/login using email, social accounts, or Apple ID.  
- **Game Data Tracking**: Ability to track key statistics (e.g., points, rebounds, assists, steals, etc.) for individual players and teams during a game.  
- **Real-Time Scorekeeping**: Users can update scores in real time during games.  
- **Player Profiles**: Each user can maintain a personal profile with historical stats, recent performances, and game history.  
- **Team Management**: Users can create teams, invite players, and associate stats with specific teams.  
- **Data Privacy Controls**: Users can define who has access to their stats and game data.  
- **Monetization via Paywalls**: Core features remain free, while premium features (e.g., advanced analytics, team branding, and exportable reports) are locked behind a subscription or one-time payment.  

=== Should-Have  
- **Web App Analytics Dashboard**: Rich game and player analytics (e.g., shot heatmaps, trends over time).  
- **Offline Mode for Mobile App**: Allow offline game tracking, syncing data when back online.  
- **Customizable Game Rules**: Support for custom scoring rules or formats (e.g., 3-on-3, streetball).  

=== Could-Have  
- **Social Sharing**: Share game highlights or stats with friends or on social media.  
- **Local Game Discovery**: Help users find local games or leagues nearby using a map-based interface.  

=== Won't-Have (Initial Version)  
- **Live Streaming**: No support for live video streaming or integration with third-party services.  
- **Official League Management**: No advanced scheduling or roster management for professional leagues.  

== Method  

To address the requirements, Courtside will employ a client-server architecture with the following key components:

== Implementation  

The implementation will be divided into modular phases to ensure proper development, testing, and deployment.  

=== Phase 1: Backend Infrastructure  
1. Set up a cloud environment (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure) for hosting backend services and databases.  
2. Implement the API Gateway using Node.js and Express.js.  
3. Develop core backend services:  
   - **Authentication Service**: Integrate Firebase Authentication for user management.  
   - **Game Data Service**: API endpoints for creating and retrieving games, teams, and player stats.  
   - **Subscription Service**: Integrate Stripe for handling payments and managing subscription states.  
4. Create and migrate PostgreSQL databases using a schema as defined in the **Method** section.  
5. Implement caching with Redis for frequently accessed data like live game stats.  
6. Write unit tests for backend APIs to ensure reliability.  

=== Phase 2: iOS App Development  
1. Build the UI using Swift and SwiftUI based on user flows:  
   - **Sign-up/Login Screens**.  
   - **Game Dashboard**: Create and manage games.  
   - **Live Game Tracker**: Input stats during games.  
   - **Player Profiles**: View personal stats and history.  
2. Implement offline mode using Core Data, syncing with the backend when online.  
3. Add secure API integration to communicate with backend services.  
4. Incorporate Stripe's SDK for in-app subscription handling.  
5. Conduct rigorous UI/UX testing on various device sizes.  

=== Phase 3: Web App Development  
1. Develop the frontend using React.js with a responsive design for desktop and mobile.  
2. Create views for:  
   - **Analytics Dashboard**: Display game trends and heatmaps.  
   - **Player Stats**: Showcase individual player performances.  
   - **Game History**: List of previous games and summaries.  
3. Use Axios or similar libraries to consume backend APIs securely.  
4. Test compatibility across major browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox).  

=== Phase 4: Deployment  
1. Deploy the backend to production servers with CI/CD pipelines.  
2. Publish the iOS app to the App Store with proper metadata and App Store guidelines.  
3. Host the web app using a reliable service like Netlify, Vercel, or AWS Amplify.  
4. Monitor logs and performance using tools like CloudWatch or DataDog.  

=== Phase 5: Testing and Feedback  
1. Conduct beta testing for both the iOS and web apps.  
2. Collect user feedback and fix any bugs or usability issues.  
3. Ensure the subscription flow is seamless and secure.
